- 👋 Hi, I’m @captain-ruffles
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, cycling, swimming, and running. I also like chemistry and physics, especially atomic structure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, I am intermediate level and improving lots!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any games or cool projects.
- 📫 How to reach me I wouldn't bother as I'm not the best programmer out there, but if you have any questions feel free to ask.
